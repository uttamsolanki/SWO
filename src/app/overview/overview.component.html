      <p><strong>SOWC – Wastewater Treatment Plant Greenhouse Gas Emissions Calculator</strong></p>

      <p>
        The Southern Ontario Water Consortium (SOWC) believes innovation is necessary to solve our local and global water challenges. These innovations become marketable solutions when private sector and academic knowledge combine in real-world environments to overcome technology commercialization challenges.

        The purpose of SOWC’s GHG calculator is to provide a valuable tool to estimate greenhouse gas emissions from a wastewater treatment plant. Technology developers, consultants, or wastewater treatment practitioners can use this tool to help evaluate the impact to greenhouse gas emissions in a wastewater treatment plant when new technologies or process modifications are under consideration. This information may be valuable to justify the adoption of a new technology or process, or to support applications for funding programs.

        Links and/or downloads to all references are provided. Note that this is a calculation tool, not a model and the sole output is an estimated calculated value for total CO2 (equivalent) when all input fields are complete.

      The design of this calculator is intuitive, user friendly, and flexible. After registering a user name and password, users must first define a new “Project”. From the dashboard, the user can create a new project or see a summary of all previously created projects by that user. The user can create and compare up to four scenarios under a project. It is not possible to compare scenarios from different projects. It may be desirable that the first scenario under a project is always a “baseline” of the wastewater treatment plant under evaluation. Users can enter any value in the various input fields, but should choose to either utilize the suggested values (sources, links, and downloadable documents are all provided where applicable) or input actual values from the wastewater treatment plant. Scenarios within a project can also be duplicated (and re-saved as a new scenario) in order to adjust parameters without starting from the beginning.  However, existing scenarios cannot be edited once saved (available as view only).

        Users will input data in three separate categories: electrical emissions, chemical emissions, and process emissions. Under the electrical emissions category, users will select the desired unit operations and processes to represent the wastewater treatment plant under evaluation. The user will either choose from the given technology options or create a custom entry for each of the liquid wastewater stream, sludge stream, biogas stream, and biosolids dewatering and disposal stream. The user will also input the power consumption on a flow basis for each unit operation selected. In the chemicals section, user inputs include the quantity of chemicals utilized at various spots and for different applications in the treatment plant. In the process emission section, user inputs include specific process values (effluent parameters, sludge production, external sludge and organics information, methane concentration, etc.) for use in the calculation. An illustration of the results for each individual scenario is in the form of multiple flow diagrams, summary tables, and summary graphs.
